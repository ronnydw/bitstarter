      <h2>About Goalsetr</h2>
          <p>Stephen Covey's book <b>The 7 habits of highly effective people</b> was a real eye opener for the founder of the Goalsetr startup.</p>
          <p>To be effective you have to give sufficient attention and effort to all the roles and aspects in your live. 
             Focussing solely on one aspect, for example your work, will lead to a burnout sooner or later.</p>
          <p><b>2010</b>: To help managing the different areas we developed an easy to use <b>paper 5x5+5 booklet</b> solution (>10,000 downloads).
             Important aspects of the solution are that <b>you always have it with you</b> and <b>use it regularly</b>.</p> 
          <p>With the strong growth of the smartphone market it becomes obvious to evolve towards a digital mobile solution in the form of an app.
             This app will give you additional benefits to <b>use it regularly</b>: 
             options to send you reminders on specific goal milestones and possibilities to share your goals and achievements 
             with people in your network or even publicly.</p>
          <p><b>June 2013</b>: Stanford University organises a MOOC (Massively Open Online Course) on

             preparation to start with the <b>Goalsetr development</b>. As student project a crowdfunding campaign site is built for which you see the 
             result here.
