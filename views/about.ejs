      <h2>About Goalsetr</h2>
          <p>Stephen Covey's book "The 7 habits of highly effective people" was a real eye opener for the founder of the Goalsetr startup.</p>
          <p>To be effective you have to give sufficient attention and effort to all the roles and aspects in your live. 
             Focussing solely on one aspect, for example your work, will lead to a burnout sooner or later.</p>
          <p>To help managing these different areas we developed an easy to use paper 5x5+5 booklet solution in 2010.
             Important aspects of the solution are that <b>you always have it with you</b> and <b>use it regularly</b>. 
             With the strong growth of the smartphone market it becomes obvious to evolve towards a digital mobile solution n the form of an app.
             This app will give you additional benefits to <b>use it regularly</b>: 
             options to send you reminders on specific goal milestones and possibilities to share your goals and achievements 
             with people in your network or even publicly.
          <p>June 2013: Stanford University organises a MOOC (Massively Open Online Course) on 
             <a href="http://online.stanford.edu/course/startup-engineering">Startup Engineering</a> what looks lke a perfect
             preparation to start with the Goalsetr development. As student project a crowdfunding campaign site is built for which you see the 
             result here.   
          <p><b>Founder</b>: Ronny De Winter (1962), married, father of 2 children, professional consultant (project management, 
             process improvement, innovation, software development), lifelong learner, further likes jogging, reading, travelling, eating out.
